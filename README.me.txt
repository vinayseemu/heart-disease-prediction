# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a machine learning web application built with **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit** that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on medical parameters provided by the user.

---

## 🧠 Project Motivation

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can help in timely intervention and save lives. This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be applied to predict heart disease using a simple and interactive web app.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset used (`heart.csv`) contains several medical attributes:

| Feature     | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `age`       | Age of the patient                               |
| `sex`       | Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)                    |
| `cp`        | Chest pain type (0 to 3)                         |
| `trestbps`  | Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)               |
| `chol`      | Serum cholesterol in mg/dl                       |
| `fbs`       | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true)       |
| `restecg`   | Resting electrocardiographic results             |
| `thalach`   | Max heart rate achieved                          |
| `exang`     | Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)        |
| `oldpeak`   | ST depression induced by exercise                |
| `slope`     | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment            |
| `ca`        | Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy |
| `thal`      | Thalassemia (0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversible defect) |
| `target`    | Heart disease presence (1 = yes, 0 = no)         |
